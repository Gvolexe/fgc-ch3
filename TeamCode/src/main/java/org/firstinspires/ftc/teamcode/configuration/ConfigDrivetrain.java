     * Note from LearnRoadRunner.com:
     * The velocity and acceleration constraints were calculated based on the following equation:
     * ((MAX_RPM / 60) * GEAR_RATIO * WHEEL_RADIUS * 2 * Math.PI) * 0.85
     * Resulting in 96.7401498872079 in/s.
     * This is only 85% of the theoretical maximum velocity of the bot, following the recommendation above.
     * This is capped at 85% because there are a number of variables that will prevent your bot from actually
     * reaching this maximum velocity: voltage dropping over the game, bot weight, general mechanical inefficiencies, etc.
     * However, you can push this higher yourself if you'd like. Perhaps raise it to 90-95% of the theoretically
     * max velocity. The theoretically maximum velocity is 113.81194104377401 in/s.
     * Just make sure that your bot can actually reach this maximum velocity. Path following will be detrimentally
     * affected if it is aiming for a velocity not actually possible.
     *
     * The maximum acceleration is somewhat arbitrary and it is recommended that you tweak this yourself based on
     * actual testing. Just set it at a reasonable value and keep increasing until your path following starts
     * to degrade. As of now, it simply mirrors the velocity, resulting in 96.7401498872079 in/s/s
     *
     * Maximum Angular Velocity is calculated as: maximum velocity / trackWidth * (180 / Math.PI) but capped at 360Â°/s.
     * You are free to raise this on your own if you would like. It is best determined through experimentation.
     *
     * WARNING: LearnRoadRunner.com's constant generator has capped the calculated recommended velocity at 90in/s.
     * This message is showing because your gear ratio/motor RPM/etc. configuration, results in a recommended
     * velocity (85% of max velocity) exceeding 90in/s.
     * (Your recommended velocity was 96.7401498872079in/s)
     * This is simply insanely fast for an FTC bot and chances are your bot cannot properly reach these speeds.
     *
     * Just to be safe, LearnRoadRunner.com has arbitrarily limited your velocity to 90in/s.
     * You are free to increase it yourself. If you do run into issues, please lower the maximum velocity.
     *
     * A documented case of a similar error which served as an impetus for this reasoning can be found here:
